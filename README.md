# Data-Science-Linear-regression-Model
Data-Science Linear regression Model for Road Accident Severity.
# Accident Severity Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting the severity of accidents based on various features such as the driver's age band, experience, weather conditions, and road surface type. Using linear regression, we aim to understand the factors contributing to accident severity.

## Dependencies
To run this project, you will need the following Python packages:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `sklearn`
- `joblib`

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn joblib
